▶ Topics: Graphs and Probability (Week 11, Week 12, and
Week 13),
Probability
▶ Probability theory formalizes reasoning about uncertainty.
▶ The set of outcomes of an uncertain event is its sample space.
▶ CS 182 considers finite sample spaces (with one exception).
▶ Each outcome x has a probability p(x) ≥ 0.
▶ The sum of the probabilities of the outcomes equals one.
▶ The probability of a set of outcomes, called an event, is the
sum of their probabilities: p(S) = P
x∈S
p(x).
▶ Inclusion and exclusion yields
p(A ∪ B) = p(A) + p(B) − p(A ∩ B).
▶ Consequently, p(A) = 1 − P(A
c
).
Probability
▶ Inclusion and exclusion: p(A ∪ B) = p(A) + p(B) − p(A ∩ B).
▶ Complements rule: p(A) = 1 − p(A
c
).
Uniform Distribution
▶ Uniform distribution: sample space of size n in which every
outcome has probability 1/n.
▶ Examples: rolling a fair die, picking a card from a deck.
▶ The probability of an event equals its cardinality divided by n.
▶ Example: the probability of throwing an odd number is 0.5.
▶ Probabilities are computed by counting techniques.
Example 1
Example 1: An urn contains four blue balls and five red balls.
What is the probability that a ball chosen from the urn is blue?
Solution: The probability that the chosen ball is blue is 4/9. There
are nine possible outcomes and four outcomes produce a blue ball.
Example 2
Example 2: What is the probability that when two dice are rolled,
the sum of the numbers on the two dice is 7?
Solution: There are 62 = 36 outcomes, with six of these sum to 7.
Hence, the probability is 6/36 = 1/6.
Example 3
In a lottery, a player wins a large prize when she picks four digits
that match, in correct order, the four digits selected by a random
mechanical process. What is the probability that the player wins
the prize?
[Hint] the sample space is {0000, 0001, · · · , 9999}

Example 3
In a lottery, a player wins a large prize when she picks four digits
that match, in correct order, the four digits selected by a random
mechanical process. What is the probability that the player wins
the prize?
[Hint] the sample space is {0000, 0001, · · · , 9999}
Solution:
▶ There are 104 = 10,000 ways to pick four digits.
▶ There is only one way to pick the correct digits.
▶ Hence, the probability of winning the large prize is 1/10000.
Example 4
A smaller prize is won if exactly three digits are matched. What is
the probability that a player wins the small prize?

Example 4
A smaller prize is won if exactly three digits are matched. What is
the probability that a player wins the small prize?
Solution:
▶ If exactly 3 digits are matched, one digit must be incorrect.
▶ There are 4 positions for the incorrect digit.
▶ For the incorrect digit, there are 9 possible choices.
▶ Hence, there are 36 possible ways to choose exactly three
digits correctly.
▶ The probability of winning the small prize is
36/10, 000 = 9/2500 = 0.0036
Example 5
There are many lotteries that award prizes to people who correctly
choose a set of six numbers out of the first n positive integers; n is
usually between 30 and 60. What is the probability that a person
picks the correct six numbers out of 40?

Example 5
There are many lotteries that award prizes to people who correctly
choose a set of six numbers out of the first n positive integers; n is
usually between 30 and 60. What is the probability that a person
picks the correct six numbers out of 40?
Solution:
▶ The number of ways to choose six numbers out of 40 is
C(40, 6) = 40!/(34!6!) = 3, 838, 380
▶ Hence, the probability of picking a winning combination is
1/3, 838, 380 ≈ 0.00000026
Example 6
What is the probability that a hand of five cards in poker contains
four cards of one kind (e.g., four 9’s, 4 Queens, etc)?

Example 6
What is the probability that a hand of five cards in poker contains
four cards of one kind (e.g., four 9’s, 4 Queens, etc)?
Solution:
▶ The number of ways to choose five cards out of 52 is
C(52, 5) = 2, 598, 960.
▶ The number of ways to choose a hand with four cards of a
kind is 13 × 48
▶ 13 ways for the kind
▶ 48 ways for the 5-th card
▶ Hence, the probability is 13 × 48/2, 598, 960 ≈ 0.00024
Example 7A: Sampling without Replacement
What is the probability that the numbers 11, 4, 17, 39, 23 are drawn
in that order from a bin with 50 balls labeled with the numbers
1, 2, · · · , 50 if the ball selected is not returned to the bin?

Example 7A: Sampling without Replacement
What is the probability that the numbers 11, 4, 17, 39, 23 are drawn
in that order from a bin with 50 balls labeled with the numbers
1, 2, · · · , 50 if the ball selected is not returned to the bin?
Solution:
▶ There are 50 · 49 · 48 · 47 · 46 = 254, 251, 200 ways to choose
the balls without replacement.
▶ Hence the probability of drawing 11, 4, 17, 39, 23 in that order
is 1/254, 251, 200
Example 7B: Sampling with Replacement
What is the probability that the numbers 11, 4, 17, 39, 23 are drawn
in that order from a bin with 50 balls labeled with the numbers
1, 2, · · · , 50 if the ball selected is returned to the bin?

Example 7B: Sampling with Replacement
What is the probability that the numbers 11, 4, 17, 39, 23 are drawn
in that order from a bin with 50 balls labeled with the numbers
1, 2, · · · , 50 if the ball selected is returned to the bin?
Solution:
▶ There are 505 = 312, 500, 000 ways to choose the balls with
replacement.
▶ Hence the probability of drawing 11, 4, 17, 39, 23 in that order
is 1/312, 500, 000
Example 8:
A sequence of 10 bits is chosen randomly. What is the probability
that at least one of these bits is 0?
Solution:
▶ The number of possible outcomes is 210
.
▶ Let E be the event that at least one of the 10 bits is 0.
▶ E
C is the event that all of the bits are 1’s.
▶ P(E
C ) = 1/2
10 = 1/1024
▶ Hence, P(E) = 1 − P(E
C ) = 1 − 1/1024 = 1023/1024
Example 9
What is the probability that a positive integer selected at random
from set {1, 2, 3, · · · , 99, 100} is divisible by either 2 or 5?

Example 9
What is the probability that a positive integer selected at random
from set {1, 2, 3, · · · , 99, 100} is divisible by either 2 or 5?
Solution:
▶ Let A be the event that the integer is divisible by 2.
P(A) = 0.5
▶ Let B be the event that the integer is divisible by 5.
P(B) = 0.2
▶ A ∩ B is the event that the integer is divisible by 2 and 5.
P(A ∩ B) = 0.1
▶ A ∪ B is the event that the integer is divisible by 2 or 5.
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)–P(A ∩ B) = 0.6
